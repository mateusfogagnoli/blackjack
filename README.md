# Blackjack (Java Swing)

A simple Blackjack game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Rules

*   **Objective:** Get a hand value closer to 21 than the opponent without exceeding 21.
*   **Card Values:**
    *   **Ace (A):** Worth 1 or 11 (whichever is better for the hand).
    *   **Face Cards (J, Q, K):** Worth 10.
    *   **Number Cards (2-10):** Worth their face value.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   The player and the opponent are dealt two cards initially.
    *   The player's cards are visible. The opponent has one card face up and one hidden.
    *   **Hit:** Request another card to increase your score.
    *   **Stand:** Keep your current hand and end your turn.
    *   The opponent must hit until their score is 17 or higher.
*   **Winning:**
    *   If you exceed 21, you bust and lose.
    *   If the opponent exceeds 21, they bust and you win.
    *   If neither busts, the higher score wins.
    *   A tie results in a "Push".
